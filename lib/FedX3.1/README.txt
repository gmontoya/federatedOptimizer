The files in this folder corresponds to the files provided as FedX3.1.zip (as it was available at https://www.fluidops.com/downloads/collateral/FedX%203.1.zip) with the modifications done to use FedX to execute a SPARQL 1.1 query without optimizing it using FedX's optimization strategies (e.g., for join ordering). 

The modified files are available at engines/fedx (federatedOptimizer repository) and were written to evaluate Odyssey's optimization approaches presented at ISWC 2017

This folder was obtained using the script scripts/enhanceFedX.sh
